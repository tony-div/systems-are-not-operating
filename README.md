## what is that?
me and some of my colleagues made this as final project to the subject: Operating Systems. this project aims to demonstrate different cpu scheduling algorithms by simulating and visualizing how they work
I developed the web api for that project, [ahmed elmakki](https://github.com/AhmedElmakki) developed the front end of it, and the rest of the team were implementing the algorithms.
believe me it has been a crazy week.
## how to use it?
first you need to install python, and these dependencies with pip: `fastapi`, `pydantic`.
then you can start the server with `$ fastapi dev main.py` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/static`
